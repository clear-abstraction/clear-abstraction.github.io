On the surface, this would seem like a good thing. But on the contrary, I believe it leads a lot of programmers to think that "they have tried that" with automatic tests and that they now have a good reason not to write tests because "it didn't work". Because the thing is, like with so many other best practices and methods - if you do it half-heartedly, you will pay the price but not reap the benefits.

My claim therefore, is this: **If you do not believe writing tests is a time-saving, quality-heightening and generally value-adding best practice - then you probably have never seen it done properly.**
