A good example of a clear abstraction is a person's name. It makes it easy to refer to the person without having to describe every detail of her every time.

I am a senior developer and an experienced code quality coach. I live in Ume√•, Sweden, with my wife and our two guinea pigs.

You could use all those words to refer to me if you want. Or you could use the clear abstraction "Mikael Brandt".
